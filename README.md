# gnn-powerflow

Graph Neural Network application in power system analysis, specifically for predicting power flow calculation.

Recent advances in Neural Network offer an interesting opportunity to integrate graph topology in a Neural Network system. This framework is called Graph Neural Network (GNN). In power systems, an electrical power grid can be represented as a graph with high dimensional features and interdependency among buses. This perspective may offer a better state of the art machine learning for power systems analysis. This study seeks the opportunity to integrate power grid topology in the GNN framework for power flow application. A comparison between several GNN architectures with equivalent model complexities are discussed. The comparison is also done for various dataset sizes. The performance of GNN compared to fully connected Neural Network over different sizes of dataset is concluded.

Graph is a structure consist of nodes and edges. Nodes are the content of the data, and edges are the connectivity between these data.
Graph is basically how the world represents itself, since many natural generated data are in the shape of graph: protein, social media, and electrical power grid.
In power grid, the buses can be seen as the nodes, and the lines can be seen as the edges. The node feature will be voltage, active power, and reactive power, while the line feature can be line current and line resistance.
